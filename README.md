# Face Recognition Attendance System
## üåü Introduction

The **Face Recognition Attendance System** is a sophisticated project that automates the often tedious task of taking attendance. By integrating the power of facial recognition, a user-friendly Python Graphical User Interface (GUI), and optional physical feedback via an Arduino microcontroller, this system offers an efficient, accurate, and engaging solution for educational institutions, workshops, or any environment requiring attendance tracking.

This project encompasses the full lifecycle of an attendance system: from registering individuals by capturing their facial data, training a robust recognition model, to the real-time tracking of presence using a standard webcam. The system also provides comprehensive data management through daily attendance logs and the option for automated reporting.

## üí° Key Features

* **Intuitive GUI for Management:** A clean and user-friendly interface built with Tkinter allows for easy student registration, model training initiation, attendance tracking control, and log viewing.
* **Robust Face Recognition:** Utilizes OpenCV's Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm for reliable and efficient facial recognition.
* **Automated Attendance Tracking:** Real-time face detection and recognition from a webcam streamline the attendance process.
* **Detailed Attendance Logging:** Records include Student ID, Name, Date, and Time, stored in organized daily CSV files.
* **Optional Hardware Feedback via Arduino:** Enhances user interaction with visual (LEDs, servo flag) and auditory (buzzer) cues indicating attendance status and system states.
* **Integrated Log Viewer:** Allows users to view the current day's attendance log directly within the application.
* **Automated Reporting (Email):** Option to automatically generate and send daily attendance reports via email.
* **Basic Environmental Monitoring (Optional):** Capability to receive and potentially display basic sensor data (light level, simulated failure) from an Arduino.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language for the application logic and GUI.
* **Tkinter:** A standard Python library for creating the graphical user interface.
* **OpenCV (cv2):** A powerful computer vision library used for face detection, image processing, and the LBPH face recognition algorithm.
* **Pillow (PIL):** Used for image manipulation during the training phase.
* **Pandas:** Provides data structures for efficiently reading and manipulating CSV files (e.g., for checking existing student IDs).
* **PySerial:** Enables serial communication between the Python application and the Arduino microcontroller.
* **smtplib & email:** Python libraries for sending email reports.
* **Arduino:** A microcontroller platform for providing physical feedback through connected hardware.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system.
* pip, the Python package installer.
* Arduino IDE installed (if you intend to use the hardware feedback features).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your_github_username/your_repo_name.git](https://github.com/your_github_username/your_repo_name.git)
    cd your_repo_name
    ```
    *(Replace the URL with your repository link)*

2.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can install the necessary libraries using pip.

3.  **Arduino Setup (Optional):**
    * Open the `your_arduino_sketch.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
    * Verify that the `BAUD_RATE` in the Arduino sketch matches the `BAUD_RATE` defined in the Python script (`your_python_script.py`).
    * Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

### Configuration

1.  Open the Python script (`your_python_script.py`).
2.  **`ARDUINO_PORT`:** Update this variable to the correct serial port of your Arduino (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`, `COM3`).
3.  **Email Settings (Optional):** If you wish to use email reporting, configure `EMAIL_SENDER`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD` (use an App Password for Gmail), and `EMAIL_RECIPIENT`.
4.  **`CAMERA_INDEX`:** Adjust if you have multiple webcams.
5.  Ensure the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file is in the same directory as the Python script, or update `HAARCASCADE_PATH` accordingly.

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

1.  **Close Arduino Serial Monitor:** Ensure the Arduino's serial port is not being used by other applications.
2.  **Run the Python Script:**
    ```bash
    python your_python_script.py
    ```
3.  **GUI Interaction:**
    * **Register New Student:** Enter a unique `Student ID` and `Student Name`, then click "Take Images" and follow the on-screen instructions.
    * **Train Recognizer:** After registering students, click "Train Images" to train the face recognition model.
    * **Take Attendance:** Click "Take Attendance" to start real-time tracking. Press the 'q' key in the OpenCV window to stop.
    * **View Log:** Click "Refresh Log" to display the current day's attendance. "Clear Log Display" clears the view.
    * **Email Report:** Click "Email Today's Report" to send the attendance log via email (if configured).
